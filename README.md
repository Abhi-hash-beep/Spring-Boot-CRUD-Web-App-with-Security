A full-stack web application built with Spring Boot that demonstrates a complete C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system with a robust security layer and a modern, dynamic frontend. The project manages a simple inventory of products, but its core focus is on showcasing secure authentication and role-based authorization in a real-world context.

The application features a custom-styled user interface built with internal CSS and JavaScript, offering a clean, responsive, and engaging user experience. It differentiates between guest users (read-only access) and authenticated users (full CRUD privileges).

## ‚ú® Key Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Complete functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.

Secure Authentication: User registration and login system powered by Spring Security.

Password Encryption: All user passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt.

Role-Based Authorization:

Guests (Anonymous Users): Can only view the list of products.

Authenticated Users: Have full permissions to add, edit, and delete products.

Dynamic UI with Thymeleaf: The interface dynamically renders content based on the user's authentication status using thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6.

Modern Frontend:

Custom, responsive pages with gradient backgrounds and "glassmorphism" card styles.

Interactive hover effects on buttons and form inputs.

Password visibility toggle on login and registration forms.

Client-side validation to confirm password matching on the registration page.

A custom, non-blocking modal for delete confirmations.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture
This project follows a standard layered architecture pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

Controller Layer (@Controller): Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes user input, and maps requests to the appropriate view or service method.

Service Layer (@Service): Contains the core business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the Controller and Repository layers.

Repository Layer (@Repository): Manages data persistence using the Spring Data JPA repository pattern. It provides an abstraction over the database.

Entity/Model Layer (@Entity): Defines the Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) that are mapped to database tables.

Security Layer (@Configuration, @EnableWebSecurity): Manages all aspects of security, including authentication, authorization, password encoding, and web security rules.
